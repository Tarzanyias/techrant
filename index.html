                            In a presentation that has captivated the tech world, Meta has unveiled its most advanced AI assistant to date. The new assistant, integrated across its family of apps, is powered by a groundbreaking new large language model. This model goes beyond simple question-and-answer functionality, boasting the ability to remember previous conversations and infer user intent.

                            The most impressive feature is its ability to understand **contextual continuity**. During a live demo, the assistant seamlessly transitioned from a conversation about travel plans to suggesting restaurants in the destination city without any explicit prompts, demonstrating a new level of conversational intelligence. While consumer availability is still being rolled out, the demo has set a new benchmark for what\'s possible in AI interaction.
